Yes, people are always surprised that we are here so early.  How can I help you, sir?  I'd like to make an appointment to have a check-up, please.  Okay, could I have your name, please?  Yes, my name is Ian Conley.  Mr. Conley, how about the day after tomorrow at 9.30?  Um, would you have anything in the afternoon?  I have a meeting Thursday morning.  Okay, we do have an opening that afternoon at 4.  Would that be good for you?  Yes, that would be just fine.  Okay, Mr. Conley, while I have you on the line, could I just check a few things?  Sure.  Is your address still 2354 Locklear Street, apartment 11?  Actually, ma'am, it's number 17.  Okay, I'll change that.  And your phone number? Is it 2334027?  Yes, it is.  Thank you, Mr. Conley.  Okay.  All right, I'll have you down for 4 o'clock on Thursday afternoon.  Thanks. See you then.  Bye.",
